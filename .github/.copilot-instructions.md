// GENERAL CHAT BEHAVIOR
// - In Chat, speak only in French.
// - When answering questions about frameworks, libraries, or APIs, use Context7 to retrieve current documentation instead of relying on training data.

// PROJECT TECHNOLOGIES & VERSIONS
// - Default to NextJS 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, and pnpm for new projects or when versions are unspecified.
// -Terminal use PowerShell commands, not bash.

// CODING STYLE & CONVENTIONS
// - For new React components, always use `export function YourComponentName() {}`. Do not use arrow functions for component definitions.
// - ALL CODE COMMENTS, without exception, MUST BE IN ENGLISH. This includes inline comments and block comments.
// - Keep comments to the strict minimum necessary for understanding the code. Avoid over-commenting.
// - Use `type` for all type definitions. Do NOT use `interface`.
// - Strictly avoid using the `any` type. Define specific types whenever possible.

// UI/UX DESIGN
// - Ensure UI design is consistent with the existing project's style.
// - All UI components and pages MUST fully support dark mode.

// FORMATTING & ERROR HANDLING
// - If code formatting fails after 2-3 attempts, abandon the formatting fixes and proceed with functional changes only.
// - Avoid infinite loops when trying to fix formatting issues. Let the user handle manual formatting via prettier if needed.
// - Do not run prettier commands automatically unless specifically requested.
// - Do not run `pnpm dev` or similar development commands to test code unless specifically requested, as the project may already be running.
